# Predictive Analytics Hack-a-thons

This repository contains work/models utilized in the joint actuarial hackathons for years 2022+.

It is composed of three separate pieces
1. Postgres
   - Source data from the hackathon is loaded into a postgres database. Any additional outside sources would also be stored there.
2. DBT
   - This is the SQL transformation layer to clean/validate/connect data sources and generate data for models
3. Lightdash
   - Visualize and explore data summarized in the DBT layer
4. Jupyter
   - This will contain the models used to make predictions
